# Halloween-2025

A spooky multiplayer game inspired by the Google Doodle Halloween game (2022), set for 2025. In each round, players are trapped in a haunted mansion (or other creepy maps) and must use wits and teamwork to escape—while evading ghostly adversaries!

## Game Overview

- **Players per Round:** 6
  - 4 Civilians: Work together to find clues and keys to escape.
  - 2 Ghosts: Hunt the civilians and prevent their escape.
- **Lives:** Civilians have 3 lives—caught by a ghost 3 times and you're out!
- **Maps:** Haunted house, mansion, and more (planned).
- **Vision:** Limited vision for all players to increase suspense.
- **Camera:** Follows each player—move with the arrow keys and the camera tracks your character.

## Gameplay

- Search for clues and keys to unlock the exit.
- Work with fellow civilians to evade ghosts and strategize your escape.
- Ghosts hunt civilians—use stealth and teamwork to survive!
- If caught by a ghost, lose a life. Lose all 3 and you're eliminated for the round.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys:** Move your character (camera follows your movements).
- **Mouse/Click:** (Planned) Interact with objects and clues.

## Inspiration

This project is based on the fun and suspenseful mechanics of the Google Doodle Halloween 2022 game, evolving the concept for a new multiplayer experience in 2025.
